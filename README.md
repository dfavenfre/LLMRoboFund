# Project Roadmap 
For the upcoming month, the project will be tested and publish on Streamlit run with the following tools
* Chatting with TEFAS Data: This tool will enable users to have interactive conversations with TEFAS data, allowing for deeper analysis and understanding. The data is scraped from TEFAS Fund list website, and the project is currently using a historical data. However, a NoSQL database tool will be attached to the use of LangChain agent when queried by the user. 

* Querying from Multiple-Document Vector Database: I'll also implement a multiple-document feature of LangChain to provide further insights for investors to query each fund's investment strategy, risks related to financial instruments that the fund makes investments in, and further information regarding the fund managers. Concurrently, only one document is embedded to Pinecone vector database, however it is working as intended. 

* Investment Portfolio Optimizer: My long-term goal includes the development of an investment portfolio optimizer that helps investors to achieve their desired percentage returns. This feature will undergo continuous refinement and optimization. Further details will be announced later, and long-term objective is also subject to change in time.
